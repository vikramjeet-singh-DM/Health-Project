Imprimis IVF Website
I started SEO on the below website 3 months ago and my company's goal was to improve its ranking as it was nowhere in the top 50 search results.
When I deep-dived into this website I found its technical performance was messed up. However, when I started working its performance improved significantly and the site started to rank on primary keywords within 3 months and now it's in the top 3 pages of google.
I have also built a non-toxic and highly competitive backlink profile for this website.
I have attached search console's comparison to the previous month. I tried to get comparison data for 3 months but that data was not available.
